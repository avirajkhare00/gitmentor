## AI based developer growth platform

### Problem Statement
Currently there is no one to give insights on how to improve a developer's profile in github.

### Solution

  - Enter github username.
  - AI agent will access github projects.
  - Suggest user how he/she can improve as a developer.

### Limitations
 - Only github is supported.
 - We judge on proof of work and not on resume/CV.
 - We will run on vercel
 - We will use openAI API for the AI agent.
 - It is going to be a free service.
 - One user is only going to generate one report.
